   This data point  has been what I have been testing the waveform matching programs on.
   The amplitude distribution appears bimodal, but I think these are all real events by
   the following reasoning:
   1. Looking at the IAT of all events, it follows an exponential distribution with Gamma = 4.28(8) per second
   2. I should expect ~4280(60) events
